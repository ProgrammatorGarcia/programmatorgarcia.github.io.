A Deterministic Finite-state Automata, or DFA, is an abstract machine that consists of:

1. A finite number of “states”, each of which is designed as either an accept state or a reject state.

2. A set of transitions that specify how the machine changes state.
Each state has one transition for each symbol in the alphabet.

3. A tape reader initially positioned at the first symbol of an input string
and capable of reading a symbol and moving to the next symbol.

4. Finally, by definition the DFA begins at state #0 (State Q1 in a diagram). 
When the input is exhausted, the DFA halts.
If it halts on an accept state, the input it said to be “accepted”.
Otherwise, the input is said to be “rejected.”

To give an example, let's take a look at the Regular Expression: ( 1* 0 1* 0 1* )*
This Regular Expression accepts strings that have an even number of 0's,
with a given alphabet of 0's and 1's.

Converting this Regular Expression to a DFA will result in this diagram:

The first state, Q1, is where the DFA begins. Zero is considered an even number, so having absolutely
nothing at all would be accepted by the expression. Whenever the DFA reads a "0" for input, it will
transition into the next state, Q2, and reject the string as there is now an odd number of 0's.
Upon reading another 0, the DFA transitions back into the first state and accepts the string,
noted by the 2nd circle bordering the state.
Note how inputs of "1" do absolutely nothing, as the expression only cares about the quantity of 0's.

Test the DFA out with these given strings:

1. 01100 (Rejected)
2. 1001 (Accepted)
3. 1111 (Accepted)
4. 0000001 (Accepted)
