  /*
   * Methods (also known as functions) act as "verbs" in the world of coding.
   * When methods are called on, they execute the code contained inside.
   * 
   * Methods are composed of several parts, let's break them down using
   * the method "helloWorld()"
   * 
   * helloWorld() starts with the word public
   * public is a term that allows the function to be used anywhere in a project of files
   * For the purposes of this class, all of our functions (and later on classes) will
   * be marked as public, for ease of access.
   * 
   * If you would like for a function to only be usable in the same file that it is in,
   * then the keyword "private" would be used.
   * 
   * Next is the keyword static. Static forces the function to be constant
   * for all instances that it is used. Any changes made to the function will be applied
   * to all parts where it is used in the main function (where code runs).
   * 
   * If we wanted to make several instances of the same function but with 
   * different changes that were independent from one another, then we would omit
   * the keyword "static", I.E., public void helloWorld()
   * 
   * PLEASE DO NOT OMIT STATIC FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS CLASS
   * 
   * The last keyword is the most important, and it is one where you will 
   * constantly change to suit your needs.
   * The third keyword is the variable TYPE that the function returns.
   * If you want to create a function that returns some output, let's say an int,
   * then your 3rd keyword for your function would be int.
   * 
   * void is a special keyword because it dictates that your function does not return
   * any value. It executes code, and then stops.
   * 
   * If we wanted our method helloWorld() to return an int value, we would write:
   * public static int helloWorld(). This would tell your compiler that this function
   * returns an int, and will accomodate for that new change.
   */

  public static void helloWorld()

      System.out.println("Hello world!!!");
  }

  /*
   * A method that sends quirky messages isn't useful.
   * A method that sends a quirky message accomodating for any name is much more useful.
   * 
   * Methods at the end have two parenthesis which can either be empty "()"
   * or filled in with variable types. "(String name)"
   * These are the 'parameters' of a method.
   * 
   * Parameters of a method can be of any kind, including
   * arrays. The data that is passed is initialized as so
   * ("variable type" "variable name")
   * I.E., (String name) (int number) (int[] numArray)
   * 
   * Multiple parameters can be passed to a method, however
   * When using a function, if the function takes in parameters as input
   * All the parameters MUST be passed in to use the function
   * I.E., (int[] numArr, int index)  (String fruit, int count)
   * Parameters are offset by comas
