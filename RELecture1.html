A regular expression (RE) is a string of symbols that specifies a formal language.
It consists of symbols from an alphabet that are “glued” together using the following operations.
If R  and S are strings in the language:

Union: R | S. (R or S)
Concatenation: RS  (R followed by S)
Closure: R* (R repeated zero or more times)
Parenthesis: (R), used to specify operations within a string, I.E, (R | S)*

For example, A(B | C)D* is a regular expression.

As a regular expression, it specifies “A followed by B or C followed by zero or more D’s.”

For example, AB, AC, ABD, ACD, ABDDDDDD, and ACDDDDDDD are all accepted strings.


Additional notations:

1. A period (.), or the wild card, representing any character in the alphabet.
In other words, for the alphabet of lower case letters: . = (a | b | c | d | … | x | y | z).

2. A list or range of symbols (if there is an understood “order” in the alphabet).
As a list, [c–f] is all letters between and including c and f.
In other words [c–f] = (c | d | e | f), and [4–9] = (4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9). 
As a range, [abcde] = (a | b | c | d | e)


3. If the symbol ^ is in braces, then it refers to the symbols not in the range.
For example, [^4–7] = (0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 8 | 9).
It can also be used on lists: [^agh] is any character that is not a, g, or h.

4. The symbol + means “one or more”. For example, a+ = a(a*).

5. The symbol ? means “zero or one”. For example, colou?r = (colour | color)

6. The combination of symbols {n} means “exactly n of these things”. For example, a{4} = aaaa
{m, n} means “between m and n of these things, inclusive”. For example, a{3,5} = (aaa | aaaa | aaaaa)

7. / is used to indicate an escape character, to use when you need a character that is also a notation character in REs:
/( /) /* /^ /| /{ /} /[ /[ and of course //
