For this lab, you will be designing Turing Machines that fulfill the provided Regular Expressions or commands.

1. Design a Turing Machine that follows the given format: (a^n)(b^n), where n > 0. The Turing Machine accepts all strings that start with a sequence of a's,
followed by a sequence of b's that match the exact same amount of characters as the sequence of a's I.E., aaabbb is accepted. 3 a's, followed by 3 b's.
aaaaabbbbb is also accepted, ab, aabb, aaaaaaabbbbbb are all accepted Strings.
(Hint: Turing Machines can replace characters. Rewrite characters as your Turing Machine reads through the String, to 'remember' what characters you've already accounted for)

2. Design a Turing Machine that checks to see if a String is a Palindrome, for the given language {a, b}. 
aabbbbaa is accepted, aaabaaa is accepted, bbaabaabbbbbbaabaabb is accepted. Similar to the previous problem, however, the Turing Machine must now keep track of what the current character is,
and where its corresponding character would be located in the String.

3. Design a Turing Machine that follows the given expression: (0^2n)(1^n), where n > 0. Your teacher is unoriginal, cry about it.
The Turing Machine accepts all strings that start with a sequence of 0's, which is followed by a sequence of 1's. The character count in the sequence of 0's must be
double the character count of the sequence of 1's. I.E., 000011 is accepted, 001 is accepted, 000000111 is accepted.

4. Design a Turing Machine that combines two strings together in the language {0}, each string separated by a '+' sign.
I.E., 00+000 should have the String finalized to 00000. 000+0 should return 0000.
(Hint: Move the 0's on the left to the 0's on the right, and once the '+' is the first character, erase it.)

5. Design a Turing Machine that performs subtraction with two Strings, each string separated by a '-' sign.
I.E., 000-00 should have the string finalized to 0. 00000-00 should return 000. The first string will always be greater than the second string, so don't worry about negative answers.
(Hint: Work backwards compared to problem 4. Go to the end, and then keep taking off 0's on both sides until the right string is completely erased.)
