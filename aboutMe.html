    I am Mr. Garcia, the 7th grade Pre-Algebra teacher and the 12th grade Logic & Computation teacher.
    
    I graduated from the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley with a Bachelor's of Computer Science with a GPA of 3.95.
    Before I was a teacher, I worked as a senior software developer for various companies under a leasing company.
    I worked primarely on Android applications, utilizing the brand new language "Kotlin" to convert software applications
    for Android phones to a modern standard. While the work payed well, I never found any satisfaction in my career.
    It never felt that I was working towards any meaningful or fruitful end.
    
    However, what I truly did enjoy the most from my experience was instructing interns, and my position as a T.A. back in
    university. Teaching is my joy. So I dismissed my prospects in software development to become a full-time teacher. I am
    grateful for the opportunity provided at Veritas, and I can't wait to see what the future has in stock!

Hobbies</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I grew up in the early stages of the Internet, back when floppy disks were still relevant.
        As a child, I was very inquisitive to how devices worked. I still remember vividly that I 
        began to dismantle computers out of sheer curiosity back when I was a wee little child of 8 years.
        It was because unknowingly I caused the CPU to overheat (the computer was of a very mediocre quality),
        and in my mind I pondered why my computer shut down. It kept reoccurring, so I taught myself the 
        intricacies of how computer hardware works, and then I fixed my problem by applying thermal paste.
        Soon I began to play around with more mechanics, such as rewiring the Wi-Fi frequency of my router
        because it kept interferring with other devices, to accessing Tor networks (not recommended),
        to modifying motherboards in computers (voiding warranty) to allow for better cooling.

        As you can see, I have the unfortunate illness that plagues all engineers. We call it "the knack".
        Sometimes abbreviated as "the urge" or "the itch", it is the desire to dismantle anything
        and everything mechanical and electrical. I am the sort of person who would pay someone to
        allow me to build them a PC. (Assuming they gathered the parts themselves). 
        
        Nowadays, I focus on artificial intelligence and the novel I am currently writting.
        My developer computer is now used to experiment on the ever growing facet of AI,
        and I cannot wait to see what the next generation of GPU's (specifically the Blackwell family of 2024/2025)
        will bring for computational hardware. 

        For entertainment, I play tabletop games with my colleagues and play video games in my sparse free time.
        For my students reading this, if you have played a video game, I have already played it or at least heard about it.

        Top favorite games of all time:
        1. Planescape Torment (Inspiration for my novel)
        3. Dwarf Fortress (Fantasy colony simulator, brings the concept of procedural generation to its absolute limits)
        3. Rimworld (Sci-Fi colony simulator, was the gateway to Dwarf Fortress)
        4. Total War: Warhammer Trilogy (Best RTS in existence)
        5. Disco Elysium (Planescape Torment's spiritual successor. Only took 20 years for a worthy one to release)
        6. Baldur's Gate Trilogy (The iconic poster child for RPGs)
        7. Outer Wilds (The one game you are not allowed to discuss with others due to spoilers. Shows how video games can be art.)
        8. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines (No other game matches the absolutely perfect atmosphere and tone of this game. Genre defining RPG)
        9. Fallout: New Vegas (Obsidian Entertainment makes better Fallout games than the people who made Fallout)
        10. Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords (Obsidian Entertainment's masterpiece, and the greatest influence for Metalhead, the co-protagonist of my novel)
        11. The Elder Scrolls franchise (Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim are classics)
        12. //Work in progress//

        As for my novel, I have been working on it for over 5 years now (how time flies).
        The name of the novel is called "Causality", and it is a trilogy set in a deterministic
        universe that is at its final stages of experiencing total heat death. One star remains,
        and two dwindling worlds, the Gate and the Planes, struggle to coexist.

        The Gate is an orbiting Dyson Sphere that is on its last legs. It strips away
        the lingering warmth of the star, using its energy to power the last remaining
        replicators that keep the vital functions of this civilization operational.
        There, the Machine God Primus, Heart of the Gate, tends to his empire.

        The Planes are comprised of floating islands centering in an endless sky. There, 
        longstanding families of Magi lead the people in a dark age of magic. 
        The world is untamed and wild and yet it is but a mockery of what it was, long ago.

        The protagonist of the story is a powerful Magus named Lucian D'aureville, the man who brought
        the Planes into its eternal dark age. He has gained a powerful ability called a sorcery. 
        His sorcery allows him to peer into the future by a couple of seconds. Uniquely, he can see 
        every possibility simultaneously in his clairvoyance. Armed with knowledge he shouldn't 
        be able to know, he can decide a new course of action, thus violating the principle of
        determinism of this world. He calls this phenomenon "The Uncertainty Principle",
        and it is the title of the first book. Before the book begins, Lucian is locked away deep in
        a forgotten cell, entrapped in the flesh of a demon as punishment for his crime against magic. 
        Through the actions of another, Lucian is freed, and armed with this power, he aims to stop 
        the death of his world by creating a ripple of change through extreme actions to fight against 
        its prophecised end.

        After duking it out with other nerds and scalpers for over a week over the Black Friday sales, I managed to obtain
        a 32:9 57-inch monitor I've been looking out for over a year now.

        And after calibration, it is beautiful.
        Productivity went up!

        Geo

        This creature does not know what love is.
        If I ever need reference on how to write a high-functioning psychopath in my stories,
        I will use <i><b>it</b></i> as a reference.
        I still love him.
