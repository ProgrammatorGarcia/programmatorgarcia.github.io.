    /*
     * 
     * 
     * This lesson is all about Big(O) notation.
     * 
     * Big(O) notation is what determines how many steps it will generally
     * take a piece of code to run some algorithm or function based off of the count
     * of the elements in some input referred to as 'n'.
     * 
     * Meaning, that if a function has a Big(O) of O(n), then it takes the 
     * method 'n' amount of steps to go over all elements of an input
     * and finish executing the given code.
     * 
     * If a method has a Big(O) of n^2, then for a given input of 100 elements,
     * then it would take 100^2 steps, or 10,000 steps, to execute the code.
     * This is a drastic jump of processing compared to O(n).
     * 
     * 
     * To showcase different Big(O) notations.
     * This example nested for loop has a Big(O) of n^2.
     * for()
     *  {
     *      for()
     *      {
     * 
     *      }
     *  }
     * 
     * 
     * An individual for loop has a Big(O) of n
     * for()
     * {
     * 
     * }
     * 
     * 
     * 3 nested for loops = O(n^3)
     * and so on so forth...
     * for()
     *  {
     *      for()
     *      {
     *          for()
     *          {
     * 
     *          }
     * 
     *      }
     *  }
     * 
     * * The method below returns an array filled with all prime numbers
     * between 2 and the number given to it by the user's input.
     * 
     * If the user inputs "10000", then the method will return
     * all prime numbers between 2 and 10000.
     * 
     * It does so by checking each number from 2 and the user's input
     * and dividing them by every number before it, and then checks 
     * if there is a remainder. If the number divides evenly,
     * then it is not prime.
     * 
     * This method is inefficient because it checks EVERY number before the
     * current number it's checking, even if it already knows the number isn't prime. 
     * If it is checking number 1000, as an example,
     * then it would check if it's divisible by 2, then 3, then 4, then 5, etc.,
     * up until it reaches number 999. Very inefficient.
     * 
     * Therefore, the Big(O) notation is O(n^2).
     * The Big(O) notation is n^2 because the program has a nested for loop.
     * (Specifically, 2 for loops nested).
     * In nested for loops, they raise the power of the notation by 1 for every for loop
     * nested in each other.

    /*
     * This other method, while accomplishing the same task, does so
     * in many less steps compared to the previous algorithm.
     * Instead of dividing the current number by every number before it,
     * it instead divides the number using prime numbers before it.
     * In general, 10% of all numbers are prime. This algorithm cuts down on the amount of steps
     * that is has to do to check for prime numbers by 90%.
     * The program also stops checking if a number is prime once it has found one number
     * that divides the current number evenly. Theoretically, this cuts down the amount of steps 
     * by an additional 50%.
     * Long story short, the amount of time it takes for the first method to find prime numbers
     * is outclassed by the amount of time it takes for the second method to do the same task.
     * 
     * This is why Big(O) is important in the world of computation. When inputs start increasing
     * in their size, then algorithms are truly stress tested.
