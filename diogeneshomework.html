        //=============================================================================
        // Welcome, student of virtue (or whatever passes for it these days).
        //
        // Diogenes of Sinope was a Greek philosopher who lived in a barrel,
        // carried a lantern in broad daylight searching for an honest man,
        // plucked a chicken to refute Plato's definition of man, and told
        // Alexander the Great — conqueror of the known world — to stop
        // blocking his sunlight.
        //
        // The Diogenes class below has already been written for you.
        // Your job is simple:
        //   1. Create an instance of the Diogenes class.
        //   2. Complete each task by calling the correct method.
        //   3. Some tasks require you to print a return value.
        //      Others simply call a method that prints on its own.
        //      Read the method to know which is which.
        //=============================================================================


        //Task 1: Create a new Diogenes who lives in "Athens" and owns 2 possessions.
        //        (His barrel and his lantern — what else would a man need?)


        //Task 2: Call the method that prints a random Diogenes quote.


        //Task 3: Have Diogenes roll his barrel through the city 4 times.


        //Task 4: Diogenes raises his lantern to someone named "Plato".
        //        Store the boolean result and print whether an honest man was found.


        //Task 5: Have Diogenes pluck a chicken to refute Plato.
        //        Print the String that the method returns.


        //Task 6: Alexander the Great approaches and requests "wisdom" from Diogenes.
        //        Print Diogenes' response.


        //Task 7: Have Diogenes philosophize about the topic "wealth".


        //Task 8: After the chicken incident, how many worldly possessions
        //        does Diogenes now have? Print the result.


        //Task 9: Have Diogenes judge a citizen named "Aristocles" who is a "senator".
        //        Store the returned String in a variable, then print it.
