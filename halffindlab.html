// Today, you will recreate the infamous, cheaty, "I cant believe Mr. Garcia made us play a game we were never going to win" algorithm.
// This algorithm finds the average of the left and right boundaries decreed by your method to find the middle value, which is then compared to your target value.
// Aftewards, this value will be set to a new boundary depending on whether your target value is larger or smaller than the middle value.
// The algorithm recurses, until eventually it either finds the number, to which it will return the INDEX of where this number is located, or, it returns -1 as the index if it cant find the number youre trying to search.

// The algorithm is a famous Computer Science algorithm, that helps introduce budding developers into working with Recursion. 
// To get full credit for the lab, you must replicate this algorithm that shall not be named (until the end of the lab), and then pass a code check with me once you have finished your code,
// and it returns the proper values given these statements in main. 

// Godspeed, students.
