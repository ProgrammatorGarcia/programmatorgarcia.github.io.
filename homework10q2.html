  Write methods that solve these multiple problems/tasks.
  

  1. Write a method that searches a value in an array that is sorted from GREATEST to LEAST, left to right,
  and returns the index of the found value.
  I.E., {10, 8, 7, 5, 4, 4, 4, 2, 1}, searching for 5 will return index 3.



  2. Write a method that finds the square root of a number using binary search.
  If the number is not a perfect square, then your algorithm returns the answer rounded down.
  I.E., the square root of 8 would be '2'.

  An easy way of solving for this algorithm would be to create a start and an end based off of your
  target. The start being 1, and the end being half of x (as the square root of x cannot be more than x / 2)

  Afterwards, get a middle value from your start and end, and then square that middle value and compare it
  to your target. If the square is larger than your target, then discard the right search space
  If the square is smaller than your target, then discard the left search space

  Repeat until your start value == end value, and then return your middle value.



  3. Write a method that gives the indexes of the first and last
  occurences of a number in a sorted array. If the element is not in the array,
  report that as well.
  I.E., {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 23}, searching for 3 will return indexes 2 (first) and 5 (last)
  Use the provided array for this problem, as the generated array doesn't have multiple instances.



  4. Write a ternary search algorithm (divides the elements in an array by 3 instead of 2)
  and then compare it's efficiency with binarySearch by timing both methods to the same array and value.
  Is a ternary search algorithm better than binary search?
