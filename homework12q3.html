        // Coding puzzle!!!

        //Given the following three values, you are to write a method that returns
        //the total number of chocolates you can eat.

        //1. Money: The money you have to buy chocolates.
        //2. Price: How much an individual chocolate costs.
        //3. Wrappers: Number of wrappers (eaten chocolates) you can return to get one extra chocolate.

        //Assume all values are positive integers and greater than 1.

        //Ex: Input: money = 12, price = 2, wrappers = 2

        //Price of one chocolate is 2. So you can buy 6 chocolates, giving you a total of 6 wrappers.
        //You can return 6 wrappers to get 3 more chocolates, which nets you 3 wrappers. You can return
        //2 wrappers for 1 more chocolate, which nets you 2 total wrappers, which can get you another chocolate.
        //Your total number of chocolates after all of this, is 11 chocolates.

    //Your methods written below here.
