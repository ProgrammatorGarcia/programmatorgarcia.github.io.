  Write METHODS that solve these multiple problems/tasks.

  1. Write a method that returns to the user a number to a specified power.
  The method will have two parameters, a base value and the exponent itself. 
  I.E., Input(2, 3) 2 is the base value, 3 is the exponent. Output: 8

  2. Write a method that OUTPUTS the smallest and the largest values
  of an array. The method takes in an array of ints, and returns NOTHING.
  You will be using the void keyword for this method.
  I.E., given an array of {2, 1, 10, 0, 7}, it outputs 0, 10

  3. Write a method that outputs the individual characters of a String.
  I.E., the String "water" should output 'w', 'a', 't', 'e', 'r'

  4. Write a method that counts all the words in a String and returns the count.
  Input: "Bobby wrote his math homework in pen." 
  Output: 7

  5. Write a method that takes 4 grade averages of 4 categories,
  and outputs the final average grade AND the letter grade.
  The categories follow different weights, so your method must
  accomodate for these weights and properly output a correct grade.
  Letter grades as followed:
  A: 90 - 100
  B: 80 - 89
  C: 70 - 79
  D: 60 - 69
  F: Anything below a 60

  Category weights:
  Homework: 15%
  Labs: 25%
  Exams: 35%
  Participation: 25%

  In order (Homework, Labs, Exams, Participation)
  Input: (95, 85, 78, 60)
  The parameters can be in any order that you want

  Output: C: 77.8

  6. 
  Write a method that constructs a silly short story using
  a few parameters of your own design. My recommendation is to
  create a few preset sentences with a noun or verb missing,
  roll a random number in the method that will be used to
  pick a preset sentence "randomly", and then ask the user
  for input for parameters for the missing nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
  Example:
  Input: ("Mordekaiser", "ice cream", "psychosis")
  Output: "On a sunny day in Detroit, Mordekaiser went"
  "to the local ice cream shop and experienced psychosis"
  "after realizing he forgot to feed his pet rock."
