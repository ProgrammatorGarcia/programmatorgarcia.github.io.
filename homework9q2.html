  Write methods that solve these multiple problems/tasks.
  DO NOT HARD CODE YOUR SOLUTIONS!!!!!

  1. Write a method that sorts an array in order of GREATEST TO LEAST, left to right.
  Ex: {2, -5, 21, 37, 5, 6, 7, 8} should be sorted into {37, 21, 8, 7, 6, 5, 2, -5}
  Also note the Big(O) of your sorting algorithm.

  2. Write a method that sorts two arrays filled with numbers into one large array.
  Ex: Arrays {2, 8, 1, 0} and {-5, 4, 7, 5} should be sorted into {-5, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
  Note the Big(O) notation of your algorithm.

  3. Write a method that finds the maximum sum and the minimum sum that an array can produce
  with x elements. To elaborate, let's say I have an array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10} (hint hint)
  If x is 4, then I must use 4 elements from the array to create my minimum sum and my maximum sum.
  The minimum and maximum sums of this array are 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) and 34 (10 + 9 + 8 + 7)

  4. Write a method that returns the most common repeating element in an array.
  Sorting the array would make this problem easier to handle (hint hint).

  5. Write a method that sorts an array of STRINGS, in order of least to greatest.
  Characters on a string are organized the same way they are in a dictionary,
  starting with the first character from a-z, a being the "least", z being the "greatest"




import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Random;

public class homework8 {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Out of bounds!!!

        //Your scanner initialized
        Scanner myScanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        

    }

    //Generates an array filled with 20 random elements that range from 1 - 20
    //For use in your homework if you want
    public static int[] newArray()
    {
        int[] arr = new int[20];

        Random rand = new Random();

        for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)
        {
            int randomNum = rand.nextInt(20) + 1;
            arr[i] = randomNum;
        }

        return arr;
    }

  }
