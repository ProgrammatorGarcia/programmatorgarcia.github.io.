    Step 1. Download VSCode and Temurin 21 from the two links provided on the website.

    To do so, click on the large buttons that say "Download Temurin" and "Download VSCode", respectively.

    (Did you know that this could be considered an archaic loose means of DDOSING a system? Let's find out when 32 laptops begin to download 300 MBs at the same time to a WIFI system that isn't built with such bandwith in mind.)




    Step 2. Installing VSCode!

    Double click on the VSCode.exe program and launch it.

    Agree to the terms. (Do not debate with the teacher about the moral implications of agreeing to terms you haven't read, please.)

    Next, on the 'additional tasks' screen, enable EVERY BOX. The boxes should be all blue and with a check. 

    Next, click install and allow the program to install VSCode. 

    Once VSCode has finished installing, please close the program and move on to the next step.



    Step 3. Installing the Java JDK! (Temurin)

    Double click on the 'OpenJDK21U'.msi executable.

    Press next.

    Accept the terms. (Do not argue about the metaphysical implications of signing an unknown contract.)

    SUPER IMPORTANT STEP WHEN YOU GET TO THE NEXT SCREEN
    FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING THAT IS SACRED AND BEAUTIFUL, PLEASE SELECT THE TOP OPTION 'Install just for you' TO AVOID ERRORS

    Selecting the bottom option will trigger the admin security screen and you'll have to restart Step 3. (There is no real consequence, Veeya does nothing anyways)

    With the top option enabled, press next.

    Ignore everything, press next to avoid confusion. (This is the page where developers get to choose their little quirky coding environments and PATH variables. Irrelevant nonsense)

    Click install and allow the program to install the Java JDK.



    Step 4. Downloading the Java utilities on VSCode.

    On the hotbar to the left of VSCode, click on the bottom option (looks like 3 squares stacked together with a fourth one tilted at a quirky angle)

    On the search bar on the top, type 'Java' and press enter.

    From the list of options, you are looking for 'Extension Pack for Java'. This has some goodies to help you with your programming to make it easier. (Without it the class becomes x10 harder.)

    Click on it, and then press install on the new screen that pops up when you click on it.



    Congratulations, you installed VSCode and did Veeya's job for them! Woooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
