Cooking Club: Meetups every Friday from 2:45 PM - 4:00 PM.
Next meetup: Friday 12/08
This Friday we will once again be grilling outside. This meetup's ordeal will revolve around a genuine American classes, a wonderful combination of meat, bread, and cheese.
I'm talking about the all-American Cheeseburger, built on a flaming hot grill. :)


Robotics Club: The club will commence after Winter Break at the start of January.
Stay tuned for more announcements!
