Cooking Club: Meetups every Friday from 2:45 PM - 4:00 PM.
Nexy meetup: Friday 10/20/2023.
Next meetup's recipe: I will somehow, through the most unholy of techniques,
create an ovenless pizza. The recipe will IMPLORE you to use an oven, but I will be using my
trusty cast-iron skillet and commit culinary heresy as I am an ovenless chef.


Robotics Club: The club will commence after Winter Break at the start of January.
Stay tuned for more announcements!
