Cooking Club: Meetups every Friday from 2:45 PM - 4:00 PM.
Next meetup: August 30th.
To all connoisseurs of good food or those wanting to learn how to cook something more elaborate than instant cup ramen with a boiled egg in it, please come on by for cooking club!

We have meetups at every Friday that's not a half-day at room 106. If you have any recipes that you would like to be made in an authentic manner and learn about or are just hungry to eat, please let me know!

See you soon!


Robotics Club: The club will commence a few weeks after school starts!
Stay tuned for more info!
