Cooking Club: Meetups every Friday from 2:45 PM - 4:00 PM.
Nexy meetup: Thursday 11/02/2023. This week I offer to my culinary students my
ùñãùñéùñìùñäùñòùñô authentic Mexican dish: Fresh flour tortillas.

Four ingredients: Salt, Flour, Water, Lard. Knead the dough, make little doughballs,
heat up a piping hot cast-iron pan, then flatten the doughball with a roller pin,
place the tortilla into the pan for 30 seconds, flip, leave it for 10-15 seconds,
take out of pan, and enjoy :)
