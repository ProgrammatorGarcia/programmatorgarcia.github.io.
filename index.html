Cooking Club: Meetups every Friday from 3:00 PM - 4:30 PM.
Next meetup: September 5th.
To all connoisseurs of good food or those wanting to learn how to cook something more elaborate than instant cup ramen with a boiled egg in it, please come on by for cooking club!

We have meetups at every Friday that's not a half-day at the cafeteria. If you have any recipes that you would like to be made in an authentic manner and learn about or are just hungry to eat, please let me know!

Featured dish: Good old fashioned grilled cheeseburgers!


Robotics Club: The club will commence in the 2nd of September! More to be announced soon!
