Cooking Club: Meetups every Friday from 2:45 PM - 4:00 PM.
Next meetup: Friday 12/15
This Friday we will once again be grilling outside.
We graduate from children, to proud men and women, by finishing the year with the most noble of dishes.
Steak. Thick Tomahawk, medium rare, chimichurri sauce. Perfection.


Robotics Club: The club will commence after Winter Break at the start of January.
Stay tuned for more announcements!
