Today you will finally recieve your first lab that is one overarching problem.
You are to design a working program that provides the utility of the
given functions in the terminal system.

The main method runs a simple terminal that can run 4 functions, each one
different from the rest. The user (you) can input a value between 1-5 which 
will allow the user to "navigate" through the terminal and perform the methods 
from the program. 

I have provided to you the foundation of the terminal. The terminal runs and has only
basic functionality. It can navigate from the main terminal to the math terminal and back,
and it can exit out when the user inputs "5", but nothing more.

Your job is to fill in and complete the functionality of the program. 
You will create methods that execute code and perform the tasks in the terminal.
The primary condition of this lab is that methods are ONLY ALLOWED in the main method.
I should not see any blocks of code in the if statements, only a single method.
Other than that, you have the complete creative liberty of designing your methods and quips
for the terminal, so long as it ultimately fulfills the task/action at hand.
