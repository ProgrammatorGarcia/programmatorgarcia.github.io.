  Welcome back! Here is an introductory lab for Quarter 2 to get you back to into the groove of coding.

  Write a program to print the following:

  1:

        *
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********

  2:

  	
        1
       212
      32123
     4321234
    543212345

  3. Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user 
  to guess what the number is. If the user's guess is higher than the random number,
  the program should display "Too high, try again." If the user's guess is lower than 
  the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again." 
  The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.

  Hint: Google the random function in java.  

4. Write a program that when given a whole number, it creates a multiplication table
  of all whole numbers that come before the given number, and uses the number itself
  as well. For example:

Please input a number
5

1 x 1 = 1    1 x 2 = 2    1 x 3 = 3    1 x 4 = 4    1 x 5 = 5    
2 x 1 = 2    2 x 2 = 4    2 x 3 = 6    2 x 4 = 8    2 x 5 = 10
3 x 1 = 3    3 x 2 = 6    3 x 3 = 9    3 x 4 = 12    3 x 5 = 15
4 x 1 = 4    4 x 2 = 8    4 x 3 = 12    4 x 4 = 16    4 x 5 = 20
5 x 1 = 5    5 x 2 = 10    5 x 3 = 15    5 x 4 = 20    5 x 5 = 25


  Write a program that takes in two numbers for input, and returns the value
  of the first number raised to the power of the 2nd number.
  For example:
  Input: 2 3     Output: 8


import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
    // Out of bounds!!!
    
    Scanner myScanner = new Scanner(System.in);  //Your scanner initialized, use as you see fit.

    
    //Out of bounds!!!
    }
}
