          //Your methods must be written in recursive form.
  
          //1. Write a recursive method that checks if a given String is a palindrome. (Hint: use the .chartAt() method in Strings to solve this problem.)
  
          //2. Write a recursive method that returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers. (Hint: Using % is the key to solving this problem.)
  
          //3. Write a recursive method that reverses a given String. (Hint: use the .substring method and you can combine multiple Strings into one using the '+' operator. I.E., "can" + "not" = "cannot")
  
          //4. Write a recursive algorithm that can find the largest element in an UNSORTED array. (Hint: The method has one if statement and 4 lines of code outside the if statement.)
  
          //5. Write a recursive method that finds out if a number is prime or not. (Hint: Your method will return a boolean. The question is what happens when you have conflicting values of either true or false.)
