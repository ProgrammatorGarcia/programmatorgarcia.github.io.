Welcome to Hash Maps. A quick run down with hash maps is that they are an array that can point one set of data inputs to another
in runtime O(1).
A hash map takes two values, a "key" and a "value". Each key points to its own value, which can be of
different or similar variable types, I.E., String keys pointing to Int values.
For example, using hash maps, you can keep track of inventory by making the "key" value the item, and the "value" value be
the number of stock that you own of that item.

const fruits = new Map([
  ["apples", 500],
  ["bananas", 300],
  ["oranges", 200]
]);

You would have 500 apples, 300 bananas, and 200 oranges with this hash map.

Your assignment is as follows:
Given the entirety of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you are to write a program that will return the top
1-word phrases, 2-word phrases, 3-word phrases, 4-word phrases, 5-word phrases, 6-word phrases, 7-word phrases, 
8-word phrases, 9-word phrases, and 10-word phrases in the book, with the challenge being that the program has to do it
under two minutes.

Here is the novel: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/74/pg74.txt">Tom Sawyer novel!!!</a>  Ctrl + left click

Download all of the text as its own text file, and then read up how to open up .txt files with your IDE and language
as input to use.

You should struggle a bit doing this assignment, as it is more difficult than your previous one.
If your code doesn't seem to be working, remember that
it's perfectly ok to restart from scratch.
